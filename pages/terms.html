                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If
                    you

                    Gold
                    Coin purchases.</p>

                <p>6.5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You agree that we and/or our Payment Administration Agents and payments
                    facilitators may store your payment information (eg card number or token) to process future
                    purchases.&nbsp;
                    By accepting these Terms of Service, you authorize Regal Technologies and/or Payment Administration
                    Agents and Payment Administration Agents and payments facilitators to store your payment credentials

                    Coins
                    when you click on the MAKE PAYMENT button.</p>

                <p>6.7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All transactions between you and Regal Technologies (where Regal

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You
                    may
                    participate in any Game only if you have sufficient Gold Coins or Sweepslots Coins (as applicable)
                    in
                    your Customer Account for such Participation.&nbsp; We will not extend you any credit whatsoever for

                <p>6.9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From time to time, we may assign minimum or maximum Gold Coin purchases as
                    specified and offered on the Platform.</p>

                <p>6.10.&nbsp; &nbsp; Once a Gold Coin purchase has been made, the funds will be drawn from your
                    financial/bank account, online wallet or credit/debit card as soon as practicable.</p>

                <p>6.11.&nbsp; &nbsp; The purchase of Gold Coins is the purchase of a license that allows you to
                    Participate
                    in Gold Coin Games and is not the deposit of funds which can be withdrawn.&nbsp; Funds used to
                    purchase
                    Gold Coins will not and cannot be refunded to you.&nbsp; Gold Coins do not have any real money
                    value.</p>

                <p>6.12.&nbsp; &nbsp; Gold Coins or Sweepslots Coins that have been submitted for play and accepted
                    cannot
                    be changed, withdrawn, or canceled and the Gold Coins or Sweepslots Coins (whichever applicable)
                    will be
                    drawn from your Gold Coins or Sweepslots Coins balance instantly.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>6.13.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are found to have one or more of your purchases returned and/or reversed or
                    charged back, your account will be suspended.&nbsp; If this occurs, the amount of such purchases
                    will
                    constitute a debt owed by you to us and you must immediately remit payment for such purchases
                    through an
                    alternative payment method.&nbsp; Until payment is received by us or our Payment Administration
                    Agent,
                    any purchases and winnings will be deemed void and requests to redeem Sweepslots Coins for Prizes
                    will
                    not be allowed.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.14.&nbsp; &nbsp; In
                    accordance

                    s a Prize; and</p>

                <p>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we may, in our sole discretion, require that any Sweepslots Coins allocated
                    to
                    you be played a greater number of times (not exceeding 20) in any combination of Sweepstakes Games
                    before it is able to be redeemed as a Prize.</p>

                <p>Void Games</p>


                <p>6.15.&nbsp; &nbsp; We reserve the right to declare Participation in a Game void, partially or in
                    full, in

                    error on
                    the pay-table, win-table, minimum or maximum stakes, odds or software.</p>

                <p>(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any request you have made for redemption of Prizes will remain

                <p>8.4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will carry out additional verification procedures for any cumulative or
                    single redemption of Prizes equivalent to or exceeding US $2,000 and reserve the right to carry out
                    such
                    additional verification procedures in the case of a request to redeem any lower amount.&nbsp;
                    Additional
                    verification procedures may, for example, include requests for, and our examination of copies of
                    your
                    identification documentation (including photo identification) such as a passport and proof of your

                    the
                    form that we require within 30 days of the date the document was first requested, then we are under

                    obligation to continue with the verification check and may in our sole discretion deactivate your

                    and
                    values in excess of US $5,000 will not be redeemed.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.10.&nbsp; &nbsp; We reserve
                    the

                    responsibility to ensure that your financial institution will accept payment of Prizes from us into

                    Account and all verification checks we require in relation to you and the other account holder are

                    not
                    satisfy our verification requirements, as determined solely at our discretion, we will not make

                    into the nominated joint account;</p>

                <p>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will not be paid into:</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.14.&nbsp; &nbsp; Where you
                    are

                    where
                    you have chosen to redeem a Prize for cash and the details you have provided are not accurate, and
                    we
                    have processed the payment using the details you have provided, the redemption of that Prize is
                    complete

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.15.&nbsp; &nbsp; You
                    acknowledge and agree that, if your financial institution will not accept payments from Regal
                    Technologies or where your bank account or online wallet does not meet the requirements in these
                    Terms
                    of Service:</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will be required to nominate an alternative bank account for payment;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There will be delays in the processing of the payment to you; and</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are unable to nominate an alternative bank account which meets the
                    requirements set out in these Terms of Service within 60 days of a request from us to do so, Regal
                    Technologies is not obligated to make relevant payments to you and may in its discretion deem the
                    Prizes
                    to be void.</p>

                <p>Currency</p>

                <p>8.16.&nbsp; &nbsp; Direct bank transfer payments are executed in USD.&nbsp; It is a Player’s
                    responsibility to ensure that their nominated bank account can accept transactions in USD.</p>

                <p>8.17.&nbsp; &nbsp; All foreign exchange transaction fees, charges or related costs that you may incur
                    as
                    a result of, or in relation to, payments made by the Regal Technologies to you are to be borne
                    solely by
                    you, including but not limited to any losses or additional costs arising from foreign exchange
                    fluctuations.</p>

                <p>Timing and Frequency for Prize Redemptions</p>

                <p>8.18.&nbsp; &nbsp; We process requests to redeem Prizes in the order in which they are received.&nbsp;
                    Our goal is to process your request as soon as practicable.</p>

                <p>8.19.&nbsp; &nbsp; We will only process one Prize redemption request per Customer Account in a 7 days
                    period.</p>

                <p>8.20.&nbsp; &nbsp; When you choose to redeem Prizes for cash you acknowledge and agree that it may
                    take
                    up to 10 business days to process the relevant payment into your nominated bank account.</p>

                <p>8.21.&nbsp; &nbsp; There may be delays in payments due to our identity verification process and
                    certain
                    payment methods will require additional verification at the time of redemption.</p>

                <p>8.22.&nbsp; &nbsp; Payments over US $10,000 may require a longer processing time than usual due to
                    bank
                    clearance and security and fraud checks and may also be paid in more than one lump sum.&nbsp; This
                    may
                    add up to 7 days to the normal processing time but is dependent on the circumstances of each
                    individual
                    case.</p>

                <p>8.23.&nbsp; &nbsp; Without limiting clause 8.8, Players can make a request to redeem Prizes of any
                    value,
                    however we reserve the right to allocate or pay Prizes in smaller increments over a number of days
                    until
                    all of the Prize has been allocated or paid.</p>

                <p>Payment Administration Agent</p>

                <p>8.24.&nbsp; &nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that we may in our sole discretion, from time to time,
                    appoint one or more Payment Administration Agents to accept or make payments (including merchant
                    facilities) from or to Players on our behalf.</p>


                <p>8.25.&nbsp; &nbsp; A Payment Administration Agent will have the same rights, powers and privileges
                    that
                    we have under these Terms of Service and will be entitled to exercise or enforce their rights,
                    powers
                    and privileges as our agents or in their own name. In no event will we be liable to any Player for
                    any
                    loss, damage or liability resulting from the Payment Administration Agent’s negligence and/or acts
                    beyond the authority given by Regal Technologies.</p>


                <p>Expiry and Forfeiture</p>


                <p>8.27.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweepslots Coins are only valid for sixty (60) days from the date you last logged
                    on
                    to your Customer Account and will thereafter automatically expire.</p>


                <p>8.28.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweepslots Coins may be forfeited if a Customer Account is deactivated for any
                    reason,
                    or at our discretion.</p>


                <p>Updating Payment Details</p>


                <p>8.29.&nbsp; &nbsp; Updating or adding additional payment details for the sole purpose of redeeming
                    Prizes
                    may only be done by you when logged into your Customer Account and when you are undergoing the
                    process
                    of redeeming a Prize by selecting the “Redeem” link which will allow access to the “Update Bank
                    Info”
                    link on the platform, where you must fill in the form “Bank Account for Cash Prize Redemption”. We
                    cannot update or add additional payment details on your behalf.</p>


                <p>Refused Prizes</p>


                <p>8.30.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you choose to redeem Prizes for cash but refuse to accept payments made to your
                    nominated bank account by Regal Technologies, you must refuse the amount in its entirety. When you
                    refuse to accept payment to your nominated bank account more than twice in any three (3) month
                    period,
                    Regal Technologies reserves the right to suspend your Customer Account to undertake investigations
                    to
                    ensure that the Platform is not being used as a vehicle for fraudulent activity.</p>


                <p>Mistaken Credits</p>


                <p>8.31.&nbsp; &nbsp; If we mistakenly credit your Customer Account from time to time with Prizes that
                    do
                    not belong to you, whether due to a technical error, human error or otherwise, the amount credited
                    will
                    remain Regal Technologies’ property and will be deducted from your Customer Account. If you have
                    been
                    transferred cash or gift cards that do not belong to you prior to us becoming aware of the error,
                    the
                    mistakenly paid amount will (without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available
                    at
                    law) constitute a debt owed by you to it. In the event of an incorrect crediting, you are obligated
                    to
                    notify Customer Support by using the “Contact” link on the Platform without delay.</p>

                    Your email must include your first and last name and a statement that you decline this arbitration
                    clause.&nbsp; By opting out of this clause, you will not be precluded from using the Platform, but
                    neither you nor Regal Technologies will be able to invoke the mutual agreement to arbitrate to
                    resolve
                    disputes.&nbsp; Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision.&nbsp; It is your decision
                    to
                    make and you ARE NOT REQUIRED TO rely solely on the information provided in these Terms and
                    Conditions.&nbsp;
                    You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and, if you wish, to consult with
                    counsel
                    of your choice.</p>

                <p>Arbitration Procedures and Fees</p>


                <p>21.7.&nbsp; &nbsp; You and Regal Technologies agree that:</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial
                    Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, or successor
                    rules,
                    which are in effect at the time of arbitration is sought (the AAA Rules).&nbsp; Those rules are
                    available at www.adr.org;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The
                    AAA
                    rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees; and</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Except as otherwise may be required by the AAA Rules, the arbitration will be held in Jacksonville,
                    Florida, or, at your election, conducted via telephone or other remote electronic means.</p>

                <p>21.8.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are a resident of Canada, this clause 21 fully applies to you in all
                    respects,
                    except that AAA Rules will be construed to mean the Canadian Dispute Resolution Procedures and
                    Canadian
                    Expedited Procedures of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Canada, or successor rules,
                    which are in effect at the time arbitration is sought.&nbsp; Those rules are available at
                    www.adr.org.&nbsp;
                    Residents of all other countries shall be subject to the AAA Rules as defined in clause 21.7(a).</p>

                <p>Arbitration to Proceed Individually</p>


                <p>21.9.&nbsp; &nbsp; You and Regal Technologies agree that the arbitration of a Dispute will proceed on
                    an
                    individual basis and neither you nor Regal Technologies may bring a claim as a Collective
                    Action.</p>

                <p>21.10.&nbsp; Without limiting the generality of clause 21.9, and as an example only, a claim to
                    resolve a
                    Dispute against Regal Technologies will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if:</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Two or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more
                    person;
                    and</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Counsel
                    for the two or more persons is the same, or share fees, or coordinate in any way across the
                    arbitrations.</p>

                <p>21.11.&nbsp; For the purpose of clause 21.10, the term “concurrently” means that both arbitrations
                    are
                    pending (filed but not resolved) at the same time.</p>

                <p>Waiver of Class Action and Collective Arbitration</p>

                <p>21.12.&nbsp; THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN
                    ARBITRATION
                    OR IN COURT, NEITHER YOU NOR REGAL TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE
                    DISPUTES WITH OR INVOLVING OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY COLLECTIVE
                    ARBITRATION
                    (AS DEFINED ABOVEJ) OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS
                    A
                    REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.&nbsp; IN CONNCECTION
                    WITH
                    ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), AS SUCH RIGHTS ARE EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED.&nbsp;
                    NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN THE EVENT ALL OR ANY
                    PORTION
                    OF CLAUSES 21.9 OR 21.12 ARE FOUND TO BE INVALID OR LESS THAN FULLY ENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY
                    OF
                    CLAUSE 21 MAY BE DEEMED VOID AND AS HAVING NO EFFECT UPON EITHER YOUR OR OUR ELECTION.</p>

                    respect
                    to your Participation and, save in the case of fraud, supersede all prior or contemporaneous

                    invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will be severed
                    from

                    the
                    fullest extent permitted by law. In such cases, the part deemed invalid or unenforceable will be

                    in a manner consistent with the applicable law to reflect, as closely as possible, Regal
