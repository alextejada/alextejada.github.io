            <p>Regal Technologies provides online games for entertainment and enjoyment of its customers. To promote
                these services Regal Technologies offers sweepstakes which awards prizes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>1. No purchase is necessary to enter or win the Regal Technologies Sweepstakes (the “Sweepstakes”). The
                Sweepstakes is sponsored by Regal Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, 16192 Coastal
                Hwy, Lewes, DE 19958 (the “Sponsor”). No entry fee or payment is necessary to enter or win the
                Sweepstakes. Any purchase or donation will not increase your chance of winning. The Sweepstakes is void
                where prohibited by law. The Sweepstakes will begin November 1, 2021 and end October 31, 2022 or when
                all entries have been distributed, whichever occurs first.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>2. Eligibility. Entrants must be 18 years of age or older and a resident of the U.S. or Canada. Entries
                will not be accepted from individuals under the age of 18 and any such entries are void. Persons who are
                employees, officers, directors, agents or representatives of Sponsor, participating retailers, their
                respective parent corporations, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, suppliers,
                distributors, franchises, and members of the immediate family and those living in the same household are
                not eligible to enter. Residents of states where this sweepstakes is prohibited by law are ineligible.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>3. How to Enter. Sweepstakes contestants will receive electronic Sweepstakes entries in the form of
                Sweeps Coins. Every 24 hours you are awarded 1 Sweeps Coin (sweepstakes entries) automatically without
                purchase when you log into your account. All Sweeps Coins awarded without purchase have the same chance
                of winning all prizes as Sweeps Coins awarded in connection with the purchase of a product or service.
                Sweeps Coins are also available free as a bonus with the purchase of Gold Coins to play the Gold Coin
                Games. You cannot purchase Sweeps Coins. Sweeps Coins have no monetary value. From time to time Regal
                Technologies may make Sweeps Coins available at no cost for additional promotions which can be modified
                or discontinued at the sole discretion of Sponsor. Additional Sweeps Coins (sweepstakes entries) can be
                obtained by mailing by U.S. Mail, first class, postage prepaid, a handwritten postcard or letter request
                with your name, full address and daytime telephone number to Free Sweepstakes Entry, Regal Technologies,
                LLC, 16192 Coastal Hwy, Lewes, DE 19958 without purchase, contribution, or donation. This envelope must
                also contain a self addressed, and stamped envelope. There is no limit to the number of requests that
                can be made but each request must be made on a separate postcard or letter. One hundred (1) Sweeps Coin
                will be provided in response to the mailed request. Sweeps Coins not played for 60 days are deemed
                forfeited at the sole discretion of Sponsor.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>4. Reveal of Sweepstakes Entries. Sweepstakes entries will be revealed electronically. Simply log on to
                your account and follow the instructions on the screen to reveal the results of your entries.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>5. Drawing of Sweepstakes Entries. The Sweepstakes consists of a finite number of entries generated and
                shuffled before the sweepstakes begins. At the time of generation the value of the entry is assigned.
                The number of entries of each sweepstakes and the prizes available can be obtained on request. Each time
                an entry is revealed, the computer draws one entry sequentially from the sweepstakes pool and displays
                the result electronically on the video monitor. Once that entry is drawn it is removed from the
                sweepstakes pool and no longer available. The game themes used to reveal your sweepstakes entries do not
                determine the results of your entries but merely display the results in an entertaining way. Sweeps
                Coins are used to reveal sweepstakes prizes. Only Sweeps Coins that are won by playing Sweeps Coins can
                be redeemed for prizes. By entering these Sweepstakes, entrants agree to be bound by these Official
                Rules.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>6. Winning Entries. Requests to redeem Sweeps Coins can be made on the website subject to the Terms and
                Conditions. Sponsor reserves the right to seek additional verification of eligibility or identity prior
                to awarding prizes for winning entries at its sole discretion. Odds of winning are dependent on the
                number of entries. Prize amounts are disclosed electronically. All prizes will be awarded.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Conditions. Upon delivery of a prize to a winner, Sponsor will be deemed to have awarded the prize to the
                winner with the winner assuming full ownership and responsibility for the prize.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>CAUTION: Any attempt made by an entrant to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the
                Sweepstakes is a violation of criminal and civil laws. Should such an attempt be made, or if the Sponsor
                suspects that there has been any electronic tampering or if technical difficulties compromise the
                integrity of the Sweepstakes, Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such entrant as
                permitted by law and to void such participant=s entries from the Sweepstakes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>7. Claiming Prizes. By claiming any prize the winner certifies eligibility and compliance with the
                Official Rules and serves to release and to hold harmless Sponsor, and its affiliates, subsidiaries,
                advertisers, and agencies from any liability arising out of these Sweepstakes. The prize winner is
                responsible for all applicable taxes. All prize winners and prizes will be reported to governmental tax
                authorities as required by law. The Sweepstakes is void where prohibited and is subject to all federal,
                state, and local laws.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>8. General Rules. Sponsor is not responsible or liable for lost, late, incomplete or misdirected entries;
                or for any computer telephone, Internet, cable, network, electronic or other hardware or software
                malfunctions, failures, connections, availability or garbled transmissions, or Internet accessibility or
                availability, traffic congestion, or unauthorized human intervention. Sponsor reserves the right, at its
                sole discretion, to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or
                operation of the Sweepstakes, to be acting in violation of these Official Rules. Any use of robotic,
                automatic, macro, programmed or similar entry methods will void all entries by such methods. Sponsor is
                not responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by web site users, tampering
                or unauthorized access, or 3 by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the
                Sweepstakes and assumes no responsibility for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay
                in operation or transmission, communications line failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to
                the Sweepstakes entries. Sponsor is not responsible for injury or damage to entrants or to any other
                person’s computers related to or resulting from participating in the Sweepstakes. If, for any reason,
                the Sweepstakes is not capable of running as planned, Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion
                to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Sweepstakes at any time. No entry will be arbitrarily
                removed, disqualified, disallowed or rejected. Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify entrants who
                fail to follow these Official Rules, applicable laws and regulations or who make any misrepresentations
                relative to the Sweepstakes, their entries, and claiming of prize. Sponsor and its affiliates,
                subsidiaries, agencies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors
                and assigns are not responsible for any negligence, claims, liability, injury, property loss or other
                damages of or to participants and/or the winner arising from, or in connection with this Sweepstakes.
                This Sweepstakes is subject to applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and are subject
                to the Regal Technologies Terms of Service.&nbsp;</p>

                List, Regal Technologies, LLC, 16192 Coastal Hwy, Lewes, DE 19958, specifying the specific Sweepstakes
                and your request to receive a complete list of winners.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>10. Disputes. Each participant agrees that any and all disputes or claims arising out of or connected
                with these Sweepstakes, shall be resolved individually, and not by class action, and exclusively by
                binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue for the arbitration
                shall be Sussex County, Delaware and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. Damages are limited
                to a refund of any money spent purchasing the product or service of Sponsor for which the Sweeps Coins
